They say people who drink a lot of water every day are healthier. They live longer than people who do not drink a lot of water. People who drink a lot get fewer health problems and old-age illnesses, like heart and lung disease. Adults who do not drink enough water are more likely to die younger, and to get old quicker.
          Researchers looked at data from 11,000 hospital patients over 30 years. The patients had visited a hospital at least five times â€“ three times in their 50s, and twice aged between 70 and 90. A researcher said: "Proper [water drinking] may slow down ageing and prolong a disease-free life." People should drink more water, juice, and fruit and vegetables with water in them. Half of people worldwide do not drink enough. An adult needs over 1.5 litres of water every day.',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
       (5,'Eating late at night is bad for us. It could make us sick. A new study says eating before bedtime increases the risk of obesity. Researchers looked into why eating late increased the risk of weight gain. Eating late makes us feel two times hungrier, so we eat more. When we eat earlier, we are less hungry, so we eat less food. Later eaters also eat unhealthier food. They also move around less before sleeping, so they do not burn off calories.
          Researchers looked at the eating habits of 16 people aged between 25 and 59. They were all overweight or obese, but were healthy. They ate regularly and exercised a little. They did not drink coffee or alcohol, and they did not smoke, or take medicine or drugs. They kept a sleep diary so researchers knew their sleeping times. A researcher said the study is telling us that, "it probably really is beneficial to stop eating late into the night".',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),

It tested a spacecraft that could change the direction of an asteroid so it doesn"t hit Earth. It is called DART. It set off in November 2021 to crash into an asteroid. DART hit the centre of the asteroid at 24,000 kph. Scientists do not know if they have changed the asteroid"s direction. They will find out in a few weeks when they get data.
          NASA said DART was the first of many "planetary protection missions". It joked about the death of the dinosaurs. It said: "We want to have a better chance than the dinosaurs had 65 million years ago." It added that all the dinosaurs could do was to "look up and say, "Oh asteroid"". NASA also said DART was a "new era for humankind". It said we could "protect ourselves from something like a dangerous, hazardous asteroid impact".',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),

Researchers in the USA studied how the brain forgets. The research may help people with memory problems. It may also help people who have depression and dementia. A researcher said: "It may sound surprising that people can control what and how they forget."
          The researcher said forgetting was important to keep the brain working smoothly. She said we can remove information from our minds. This is lets us focus on important tasks. We can control what we forget, but the act of forgetting needs a lot of effort. Another researcher said forgetting unimportant information is useful. Researchers will now look at why we forget simple things like where we left our keys.',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),

The research found that car fumes changed our brain"s connectivity in two hours. A researcher was surprised by his research. He said: "For many decades, scientists thought the brain may be protected from the harmful effects of air pollution." He said his study shows there is a connection between air pollution and thinking.
           The study was on 25 adults. They breathed car fumes in a laboratory. Scientists took brain scans of the adults for two hours. The scans showed that the thinking networks in the brain changed. There were fewer connections between the networks. Another professor was worried by how traffic pollution changed the networks. She said people should close car windows when in traffic. The brains of the 25 people were OK after they breathed clean air.',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),

He was born before Britain"s Queen Victoria became queen, and before the invention of the postage stamp and the *.
          Jonathan had a good birthday. He had a three-day party, with a special tortoise birthday cake full of his favourite vegetables. Sadly, Jonathan did not get to see anything because he is blind. He also cannot smell. However, his ears are OK, so he could hear "Happy Birthday" being sung. Also, he still has plenty of energy.
